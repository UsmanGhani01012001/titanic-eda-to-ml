Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)This repository contains an introductory exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset. The primary goal of this project is to understand the dataset's structure, identify key characteristics, and visualize initial patterns and relationships within the data, particularly focusing on passenger demographics and survival rates.FeaturesData Loading and Initial Inspection: Efficiently loads the Titanic-Dataset.csv file and provides a quick overview of its contents (.head()).Data Summarization: Utilizes df.info(), df.describe(), and df.nunique() to provide comprehensive summaries of data types, non-null counts, statistical distributions, and unique values per column.Missing Value and Duplication Check: Identifies and quantifies missing values (.isnull().sum()) and duplicate rows (.duplicated().sum()) to assess data quality.Basic Data Visualization: Includes an example of using Seaborn to create a count plot for the 'Sex' column, demonstrating foundational visualization skills.DatasetThe project uses the Titanic-Dataset.csv file, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes). This is the target variable.Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).Name: Passenger's name.Sex: Passenger's gender.Age: Passenger's age.SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.Ticket: Ticket number.Fare: Passenger fare.Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).Project StructureThe core analysis is contained within a single Python script or Jupyter Notebook (as provided), demonstrating a clear, sequential flow of data loading, inspection, and visualization.titanic_eda.py (or titanic_eda.ipynb): The main script/notebook containing all the code for the exploratory data analysis.Titanic-Dataset.csv: The dataset file used in the analysis.requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python dependencies.README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.SetupClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Data:Place the Titanic-Dataset.csv file in the root directory of your cloned repository, alongside the Python script.UsageTo run the exploratory data analysis and generate the output:python titanic_eda.py
(If it's a Jupyter Notebook, you would open it in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.)The script will print data summaries to the console and display plots (like the 'Sex' count plot) as interactive windows.Key Learnings DemonstratedThis project showcases fundamental data analysis skills, including:Data Loading and Handling: Proficiency with pandas for tabular data manipulation.Data Quality Assessment: Ability to identify missing values and duplicates.Descriptive Statistics: Understanding and utilizing methods to summarize numerical data.Categorical Data Analysis: Initial exploration of categorical features through value counts and simple visualizations.Data Visualization: Competence in using matplotlib and seaborn for basic plots.This foundational EDA is crucial before proceeding to more complex tasks such as feature engineering or predictive modeling.
